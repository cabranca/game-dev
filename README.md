# Cabrankengine

Cabrankengine is a 2D/3D game engine written in C++ with OpenGL, designed for Windows and Linux (64-bit).  
The project is focused on learning, experimentation, and building a clear interface for game development.

## Showcase

Here are some examples of prototypes and experiments made with Cabrankengine:

### Vampire Survivors style prototype

## Current Features

- Entity Component System (ECS) architecture (basic).
- 2D and 3D rendering with OpenGL.
- Cross-platform input system.
- 2D/3D camera with movement controls.
- Basic audio support using irrKlang.
- ImGui integration for real-time debugging and parameter editing.
- Initial 2D/3D collision support.
- Unit testing with Catch2.

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
- Windows or Linux (64-bit)  
- C++17 or higher  
- [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/)  

### Steps
```bash
# Generate build files
premake5 gmake2      # Linux
